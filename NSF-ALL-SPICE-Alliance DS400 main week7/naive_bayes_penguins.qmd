### Story

Weâ€™ll start our naive Bayes classification with just a single penguin. Suppose an Antarctic researcher comes across a penguin that weighs less than 4200g with a 195mm-long flipper and 50mm-long bill. Our goal is to help this researcher identify the species of this penguin, Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo.

#### Let's Plot!

Make a visualization that will help the researcher determine the species based on the characteristics described above

```{r}
data(penguins_bayes)
penguins <- penguins_bayes
```
